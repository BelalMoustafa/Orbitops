    "aboutInfo": "## About this project\n\n**OrbitOps** is a real-time, WebGL-based interactive simulation of our solar system. This visualization uses data provided by the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory at NASA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) and [Keplerian equations](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/approx_pos.html) to determine the positions of planets and satellites at any given time.\n\n## Instructions\n\n* Use your mouse, trackpad, or touch screen to orbit around a visual.\n* Click on a planet or satellite label to focus on it, and click on the visual name to see information on it.\n* To zoom, scroll or pinch the screen, or move the vertical slider located on the left.\n* Change the date of the visualization using the calendar on the top right corner, and use the **Speed Scale** to inflate time.\n* Use the **Planet Scale** slider to change the size of the planets and their satellites.\n* Toggle the sound by clicking the volume bars on the bottom left.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis visualization doesn't account for astronomical anomalies (such as aberrations from other celestial objects), so accuracy is only guaranteed within a few hundred years from the current.\n\n## Credits\n\n* Project developed by Belal Moustafa, Hamza Fattouh, Saud Kareem, Mohamed Atef, and Ziad Sameh.\n* Planetary ephemerides courtesy of [NASA](https://jpl.nasa.gov/) and the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.nasa.gov/).\n* Orbital textures by [James Hastings-Trew](http://planetpixelemporium.com/) and contributors to the [Celestia Motherlode](http://www.celestiamotherlode.net/).\n* Frameworks used [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)/[Redux](http://redux.js.org/), [THREE.js](https://threejs.org), and [react-three-renderer](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer)."
